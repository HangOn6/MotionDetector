Motion Detector System

The objective of this project is to process live video stream and detect any motion of an object or objects.
In addition to detecting the object the system also marks the timing i.e. it takes into account the timing of entering and leaving the video
And creates an excel file where it writes down those exact timings of entry and exit.
This entire application can be of use in detecting animal movements or maybe during safety


The xml file contains the features of a face and it detects faces.It has all the characteristic features of a face

Motiondetector.py : This is the main code that runs the whole process.

Prerequisites
The local machine needs to be installed with Python 3.7 with OpenCv, Pandas and Glob(for reading filepaths)

Visual Studio Code, Google Colab ,Jupyter Notebook, Pycharm, Atom etc any editor can be used
